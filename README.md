# Digital Media App

This is a full-stack Digital Media App that allows users to upload, view, and interact with various forms of digital media, such as images and videos. The app consists of two main components: the **backend** responsible for managing user accounts, media uploads, comments, likes, and other core functionalities, and the **frontend** which provides the user-friendly interface for interacting with the app.

Please refer to the respective README files for detailed information on each component:

- [Backend README](./backend/README.md)
- [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md)

## Overview

### Backend

The backend handles user management, media uploads, comments, likes, and more. It's built with Node.js Express.js and uses MongoDB as the database. To get started with the backend, follow the instructions in the [Backend README](./backend/README.md).

### Frontend

The frontend is designed in React and provides the user interface for interacting with the app. It offers features like user authentication, post creation, post interactions, user profiles, and more. To get started with the frontend, follow the instructions in the [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md).
